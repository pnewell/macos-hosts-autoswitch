#
# Keep a single /etc/hosts entry pointing at a host's LAN IP while you're on
# your home/trusted network, and at its remote (e.g. Tailscale) IP everywhere
# else -- so you can use one short name no matter where you are.
#
# "Am I home?" is decided by SSH host-key IDENTITY, not by IP or subnet: the
# LAN IP is trusted only if whatever answers there presents the host's pinned
# host key. A different device sitting at the same LAN IP on a foreign network
# therefore cannot hijack the name.
#
# Because /etc/hosts is consulted before DNS, resolution keeps working even
# with a full-tunnel VPN (e.g. Proton VPN) that would otherwise capture DNS.
#
# Run by the LaunchDaemon on every network change. Safe to run by hand too.
#
# Testing without root (writes to a throwaway file):

# literal field comparison (not a regex) also means dots or other regex
# metacharacters in the hostname -- e.g. an FQDN like "my.host" -- are treated
# literally. Comment lines (starting with #) are passed through untouched, even
# if their second token equals the host, so user comments are never dropped.
#
# Note: this manages the line where the host is the *canonical* (first) name.
# If you also list the host as a trailing alias on some other line, that line
# is left alone -- don't do that (see README).
